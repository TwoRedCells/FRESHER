License
-------
This software is being developed as an entry in the *2014 Intel RealSense App Challenge*.
While it is open-source, it is **not** currently licensed for use. It is expected that a
permissive open license will be adopted when the competition concludes.

What is it?
-----------
*FRESHER* is intended for people who are researching human subjects. It is a toolset that
allows the researcher to:
* design and build experiments
* run experiments
* record reaction
* process and store data
* analyse data

Who it is for?
--------------
The term researchers includes a lot of people, such as academia, students, individuals 
at corporations, or even hobbyists. Some of the fields that might find *FRESHER* useful are:
* psychology
* marketing
* education/training

How does it work?
-----------------
In order to build an experiment, a researcher needs to write a script. *FRESHER* exposes an
API to do this very easily. A simple experiment can be created with very little or no
programming knowledge. 

Instead of inventing and requiring a new scripting language,
FRESHER lets researchers use a language that they may already know, or if not, could be
learned easily. Two languages are currently supported, Python and C#. JavaScript may be
added at a later date, and other languages will be considered depending on demand.

What kind of experiments are possible?
--------------------------------------
This is probably best answered with some examples. The common theme is that experiments
are intended to gauge *reaction*, *sentiment*, and *emotion*.
* Find the subject's reaction to two different graphic designs.
* Find the subject's reaction to several video clips.
* Find the subject's reaction to several images.
* Find the subject's reaction to several sounds.
* Have the subject solve a problem.

What are the System Requirements?
---------------------------------
The minimum requirements are:
* A Windows computer capable of running the .NET Framework 4.5.1
    * Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7 SP1, Windows Vista SP2, Windows PE, 
      Windows Server 2012 R2, Win
    * Processor: 1 GHz, RAM: 512MB
    
The recommended configuration includes:
* Video: 1920x1080 resolution
* Monitor: 22" or larger
* Camera: Intel RealSense camera (Creative VF0800)
* CPU: 4th-generation Intel Core processor
